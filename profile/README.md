# Pridecraft Studios

We're [Pridecraft Studios](https://pridecraft.gay), a collective of developers making LGBT-themed modifications to Minecraft.
We make everything from Resource Packs to Mods, without overgaying the
game and making it look like somebody just vomited rainbows all over the place.

The only things we feel more free to “overqueer” (not that there is such a thing, too much gayness) is our mod, because,
well, it’s *our* mod.

In our modifications, we aim to not make the whole game rainbow. Not changing the terrain blocks, for example, is
something we do to make the game not look like flat rainbows.

For our Resource Packs, we change smaller things, such as beds and entities. In our mod, we may make a Gay Ore so some
very rainbow biome generation will at least make some sense.

If you want to contribute, check out our [Github](https://git.pridecraft.gay/) repositories, or

# Projects

## Pridepack

Pridepack is a simple vanilla+ modpack that changes some aspects of the game, such as bees and beds, to be themed with LGBT flags.

## PrideGUI

PrideGUI is an addon, or standalone pack for Minecraft: Java edition that themes the game's UI. What? Did you think GUI meant Graphical User Interface? Of course it's GAY user interface!

<!--# Pridecraft Studios
We are a team making LGBTQ+ content for Minecraft. Currently, we have [Pridepack](https://git.pridecraft.gay/pridepack) and [PrideGUI](https://git.pridecraft.gay/pridegui) in active development, and it's the only ones we've released so far.
## Why are you doing this?
We felt like there wasn't much Pride content for Minecraft. Most of what we found were either outdated, or were *flat* rainbow textures.
We wanted to make something different, something better. We want the stuff we make be over the ones that ***make the game look like someone vomited rainbows all over the place.***
## Support us on Ko-Fi!
We make free modifications for everyone. Any donation is appreciated and will help us continue to gay the game further!

## Stuff we made
## Pridepack
Pridepack is the first pack we *ever* made. It has biis and pride beds, and some in-dev features, like trans Alliums and Pride Flowers, as well as *something* for the new [Crafter Block](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafter)
