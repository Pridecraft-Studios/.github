# Pridecraft Studios
We are a collective of developers making LGBT content for Minecraft.

We make Resource Packs and mods to add LGBT themed stuff to the game, while trying to not "overgay". The main difference of our stuff compared to other LGBT Minecraft packs is that we know how to keep the game from looking like someone vomited rainbows all over the place.

# Projects
These are the projects we are currently working on!

## Pridepack
[Pridepack](https://modrinth.com/prioject/Pridepack) is our first and most popular project, adding LGBT tweaks to the game in decoration blocks and on some entities, like axolotls, bees, foxes and sniffers. It is also available for Bedrock Edition on [MCPEDL](https://mcpedl.com/pridepack)

## Joy
[Joy](https://git.pridecraft.gay/joy) is an upcoming mod adding all content from Pridepack, and other LGBT-related features to Minecraft. It will even feature its own OST! The mod is on really early development, and still on planning phase.

## PrideBones
[PrideBones](https://modrinth.com/project/pridebones) is a version of Pridepack based on Bare Bones' style, which has a more simplistic look to it, similar to the Minecraft Trailers art style.
