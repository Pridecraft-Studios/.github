# Pridecraft Studios
We are a team making LGBTQ+ content for Minecraft. Currently, we only have [Pridepack](https://git.pridecraft.gay/pridepack) and variations of it on active development, and it's the only one we've released so far.
## Why are you doing this?
We felt like there wasn't much Pride content for Minecraft. Most of what we found were either outdated, or were *flat* rainbow textures.
We wanted to make something different, something better. We want the stuff we make be over the ones that ***make the game look like someone vomited rainbows all over the place.***
## Support us on Ko-Fi!
We make free modifications for everyone. Any donation is appreciated and will help us continue to gay the game further!

## Stuff we made
## Pridepack
Pridepack is the first pack we *ever* made. It has biis and pride beds, and some in-dev features, like trans Alliums and Pride Flowers, as well as *something* for the new [Crafter Block](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafter)
