# Pridecraft Studios

We are a collective of developers making LGBTQ+ content for Minecraft.

We make resource packs and mods to add pride-themed stuff to the game, while trying not to “over-gay”.
The main difference when compared to other packs,
is that we know how to keep the game from looking like someone vomited rainbows all over the place.

# Projects

These are the projects we are currently working on!

## Pridepack

[Pridepack](https://modrinth.com/project/pridepack) is our first and most popular project,
adding LGBT tweaks to the game in decoration blocks and on some entities,
like axolotls, bees, foxes and sniffers.
It is also available for Bedrock Edition on [MCPEDL](https://mcpedl.com/pridepack).

## PrideGUI

[PrideGUI](https://modrinth.com/project/pridegui) is our GUI resource pack,
adding a nice dark-themed UI with pride to all containers.
It has a variant for every Minecraft version, starting from Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.

## Joy

[Joy](https://git.pridecraft.gay/joy) is an upcoming mod adding pride content,
including all content from Pridepack, to Minecraft.
It will even feature its own OST!
Joy is really early in development, and is still in planning phase.

## PrideBones

[PrideBones](https://modrinth.com/project/pridebones) is a version of Pridepack based on Bare Bones’ style,
which has a more simplistic look to it, similar to the Minecraft Trailers art style.
